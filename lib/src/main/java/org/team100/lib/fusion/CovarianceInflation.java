/**
 * Covariance Inflation
 * 
 * Result vvariance is inverse variance weighting, with two terms for covariance
 * inflation:
 * 
 * * mean dispersion weight: reduce the influence of mean dispersion, but not to
 * zero.
 * * minimum state variance: avoid state variance collapse.
 * 
 * I tuned these terms by eye, in this sheet:
 * https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DmHL1UDd6vngmr-5_9fNHg2xLC4TEVWTN2nHZBOnje0/edit?gid=1604242948#gid=1604242948
