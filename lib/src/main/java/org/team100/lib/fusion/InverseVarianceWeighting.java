/**
 * Inverse-variance weighting is the maximum-likelihood estimator.  Repeated
 * fusions of the same input represent additional "evidence" and so the result
 * becomes progressively more confident.
 * 
 * It tends to become overconfident ("covariance collapse") because the operands
 * are often not as independent as we may think they are.
 * 
 * This method also does not take the dispersion of the means into account: it
 * returns a confident result even when the operand means are very different.
 * The result is that the fusion can easily become very confident about the
 * wrong value.
